# Zindi_Flight_Delay_Prediction_Challenge

Flight delays not only irritates air passengers and disrupt their schedules but also cause :

- decreased efficiency
- increased capital costs, reallocation of flight crews and aircraft
- additional crew expenses

Most passengers choose air travel due to its relative safety and timeliness. This means that delays would most likely have a negative impact on passenger demand.

This project aims to predict the estimated duration of flight delays per flight using dataset gotten from the zindi flight delay prediction challenge.

This solution proposes to build a flight delay predictive model using Machine Learning techniques. The accurate prediction of flight delays will help all players in the air travel ecosystem to set up effective action plans to reduce the impact of the delays and avoid loss of time, capital and resources.
